## Executive Summary
 ### Describe the Problem
 The steps of finding job listings from various websites and segregating them are hard and time-consuming. Many job seekers are unable to find job details on various sites.
 Life is so dull with all these modern video games. We're resurfacing a good ol' classic with this one! Blackjack, a game that will never cease to bore you especially with money put on the line. 
 This will hopefully be Blackjack with some additional whacky spins.
 
 ### Process to Solve the Problem
 1. Developing a terminal-based application to search for and retrieve relevant job postings.
 2. Implementing a web scraper to extract job listings from multiple websites whilst adhering to website scraping protocols and federal laws.
 3. Exporting the job listing data into a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file with a standardized format for use in other applications.
 
### Proposed Solution
Our problem at hand was finding the job listings from various web sites and scraping them to make it less time consuming. The solution to this is creating a program that sorts this out and makes it a little bit easier to sort through the data. Sorting through the data with a program will fix the problems of duplicate job listings, missed deadlines, and just make it faster to find the data faster. In general, this will solve our problem of making job listings easier to sort through and reducing the time it takes to search for jobs.
 
 ### Expected Deliverables
 - Secure documentation on the program itself.
 - Design that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
 - Documentation that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
 - Software artifacts that sort the data out and allows for an easier time when looking at job listings by the end of the waterfall project timeline.
