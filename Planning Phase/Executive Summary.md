## Executive Summary
### Describe the Problem
Life is so dull with all these modern video games. We're resurfacing a good ol' classic with this one! Blackjack, a game that will never cease to bore you especially with money put on the line. 
This will hopefully be Blackjack with some additional whacky spins.

### Process to Solve the Problem
1. Off the start, develop a computer based Blackjack game with the player being you!
2. This will be terminal based at the start and may change.
3. Once the basic game has been "developed", we'd like to also add tons of features whether it's multiple players, multiple computers, etc..
4. Figure out and develop the additional features that are wanted.

### Proposed Solution
Our problem is that these new games are ruining the younger generation's mind! We'd like to resurface one of the greatest classic games, Blackjack, with extra twists to make it more appealing.
Adding onto our classic Blackjack template, we'd like to add fun aspects like health, more players, and more gambling, because who doesn't love gambling?
This will allow our program to favor those who are maybe just a little bit on the newer generation.

### Expected Deliverables
- Secure documentation on the program itself.
- Design that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
- Documentation that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
- Software artifacts that sort the data out and allows for an easier time when looking at job listings by the end of the waterfall project timeline.
