## Executive Summary
### Describe the Problem
The steps of finding job listings from various websites and segregating them are hard and time-consuming. Many job seekers are unable to find job details on various sites.

### Process to Solve the Problem
1. Developing a terminal-based application to search for and retrieve relevant job postings.
2. Implementing a web scraper to extract job listings from multiple websites whilst adhering to website scraping protocols and federal laws.
3. Exporting the job listing data into a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file with a standardized format for use in other applications.

### Proposed Solution
Our problem at hand was finding the job listings from various web sites and scraping them to make it less time consuming. The solution to this is creating a program that sorts this out and makes it a little bit easier to sort through the data.
Sorting through the data with a program will fix the problems of duplicate job listings, missed deadlines, and just make it faster to find the data faster. In general, this will solve our problem of making job listings easier to sort through and reducing the time it takes to search for jobs.

### Expected Deliverables
- Documentation that completely outlines the parameters and everything that we do in the project itself.
- At least six sprints completely done.
- Documentation that might hekp the user understand the project.
- A program that functions like Blackjack.
- Funky additions to the Blackjack game that make it more innovating.
