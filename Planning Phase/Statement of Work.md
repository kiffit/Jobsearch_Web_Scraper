# Statement of Work

## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to design and develop a functional system that meets the specified requirements while maintaining security, usability, and reliability. The project will follow a structured timeline to ensure smooth progress, with clearly defined milestones.

Key objectives include:
- **User Interaction & Experience**
  - Develop a Python terminal-based interface where users can input job search criteria and retrieve relevant job postings.
  - Allow users to enter search parameters (job title, location, keywords) using command-line prompts.
  - Display job search results in a structured format for easy reading and analysis.
  - Job listings will automatically be saved to a csv file format for ease of access.

- **Data Extraction & Automation**
  - Implement a web scraper that efficiently extracts job listings from multiple websites.
  - Ensure the system can handle large amounts of job postings while preventing duplicate entries.
  - Optimize the scraper for performance and minimal bot detection interference.
 
- **Security & Compliance**
  - Protect the system from bot detection and blocking mechanisms by job websites.
  - Ensure compliance with ethical scraping practices and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Data Management & Exporting**
  - Structure extracted job data into a formatted, readable output in the Python terminal.
  - Export job listings automatically as a CSV file.
  - Data is automatically exported to a CSV file keeping it lightweight and within scope.

- **Testing, Deployment, and Documentation**
  - Conduct thorough security testing to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.
  - Optimize the system for performance, reliability, and scalability.
  - Finalize and document all system functionalities, user guides, and API references (if applicable).
  - Prepare a final project presentation, summarizing objectives, challenges, and solutions.
