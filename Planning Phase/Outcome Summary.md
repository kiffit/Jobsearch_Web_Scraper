# Expected Outcomes

The final product will be a fully functional and secure system that meets all predefined requirements and objectives. 

The key expected outcomes are detailed below:

## Functional System
The final system will be developed according to the requirements gathered during the initial phases. It will include:

### Core Feature
- **Automated Job Scraping** – Extracts job listings from multiple job websites and company career pages.
- **Search & Filtering Options** – Users can input job search criteria (title, location, keywords).
- **Data Organization & Export** – Scraped job listings will be structured and saved in a CSV format for easy access and analysis.
  
### User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)
- The program will run entirely through the Python terminal.
- Users will input search parameters via command-line prompts.
- The scraper will retrieve and process job postings, displaying them in a formatted output.
- Job listings will automatically be saved to a csv file format for ease of access. 
- The interface will provide clear instructions and structured output, ensuring ease of use.

## Security & Compliance
### Security Features
- **Firewall Protection & CAPTCHA Handling** – Prevents blocking from job websites while maintaining ethical scraping practices.
- **Data Privacy & Responsible Data Handling** – Ensures that stored job data is protected from unauthorized access.

### Compliance Measures
- **Respecting Website Terms of Service** – The scraper will follow best practices to avoid violating website policies.
- **Responsible Data Handling** – The system will only store job listing data and will not collect personal or sensitive user information.
  
## Stability & Reliability
### Feature Freeze (March 5th)
- All core system features will be finalized, with no further additions to ensure stability.

### Final Debugging & Optimization
- Code efficiency improvements to speed up job scraping and data processing.
- Error handling and logging mechanisms to manage failed scraping attempts.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Functionality Testing** – Ensures scraping results match expected outputs.
- **Performance Testing** – Optimizes for efficient execution within terminal constraints.
- **Usability Testing** – Ensures a smooth user experience through clear prompts and outputs.

## How Users Will Interact with the System
### Step 1: Run the Python Script
Users execute the script in the Python terminal.

### Step 2: Input Search Parameters
The program prompts users to enter job search criteria such as:
- Job title (e.g., “Software Engineer”)
- Location (optional)
- Keywords (e.g., “Remote,” “Entry-level”)

### Step 3: Initiate Job Scraping
The scraper fetches real-time job listings based on user inputs.

### Step 4: Display & Manage Job Listings
Results appear directly in the terminal in a structured, readable format.

### Step 5: Export Data
Job listings are automatically saved to a csv file format.
