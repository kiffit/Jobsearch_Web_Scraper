# Security Requirements
## Input Validation:
- All input needs to be validated, via type checking, out of bounds handling etc..
- All data with no input needs to have the same entry, ex. NULL.
- Try and excepts should be used on most if not all validation checks.
- If a try and except fails, display error message to explain why it failed.

## Website Guidelines:
- Checking website guidelines to make sure our scraper doesn't break TOS is mandatory.
- Must provide the link to the website TOS and/or valid robot.txt file (both if at all possible) in documentation to show they were viewed and easily accesible for others convience to read through and double check.
- Read thoroughly to minimize easily avoidable accidental breaks of the TOS.

## CSV
- Make sure writing over CSV files is secure and not accessible to the user, and files get properly closed when done being used.
