## Executive Summary
### Describe the Problem
The steps of finding job listings from various websites and segregating them are hard and time-consuming. Many job seekers are unable to find job details on various sites.

### Process to Solve the Problem
1. Identifying the problem.
2. Defining the problem.
3. Forming a strategy to solve the problem at hand.
4. Organizing out information to solve / code our problem solver.
5. Allocating our team members on the various jobs needed.
6. Monitoring what we do and what we need to do.
7. Evaluating what we've done compared to what we had originally planned out.
8. Recap everything and hopefully our problem / code is solved by then.

### Proposed Solution
Our problem at hand was finding the job listings from various web sites and scraping them to make it less time consuming. The solution to this is creating a program that sorts this out and makes it a little bit easier to sort through the data.
Sorting through the data with a program will fix the problems of duplicate job listings, missed deadlines, and just make it faster to find the data faster. In general, tihs will solve our problem of making job listings easier to sort through and less time consuming.

### Expected Deliverables
- Secure documentation on the program itself.
- Design that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
- Documentation that comes with the program that would help the user better understand the system.
- We are expected to be at least completed with a program that sorts the data out and allows for an easier time when looking at job listings by the end of the waterfall project timeline.
