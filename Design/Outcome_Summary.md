# Expected Outcomes

The final product will be a fully functional and secure system that meets all predefined requirements and objectives. The key expected outcomes are detailed below:

## Functional System
The final system will be developed according to the requirements gathered during the initial phases. It will include:
- **Core Features**: The essential features will meet the user requirements and objectives of the project.
- **User Interface (UI)**: The user interface and the front end will have a perfect design, and user interaction will be easier.
- **Backend System**: We use a backend architecture that will be stable and highly efficient in handling various critical system operations.
- **Security Features**: The security firewalls can prevent the system's back door attacks and ensure protection against illegal access.
  
## Security & Compliance
- **Thorough Security Testing**: By March 5th, we will lock all system features and implement all basic facilities without any new developments to maintain control and control.
- **Data Protection**: We handle all sensitive information safely and store it securely to avoid information leakages and hacking.
  
## Stability & Reliability
- **Feature Freeze**: By March 5th, all system features will be locked, and no new development will occur to ensure stability.
- **Final Debugging & Optimization**: The final tweaks, if needed, and optimizations to enhance the performance of the system.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance**: System performance tests will be done before using it to ensure that it's reliable and of high-quality software.
