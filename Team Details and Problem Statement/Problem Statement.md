## What the problem is
The steps of finding job listings from various websites and segregating them are hard and time-consuming. Many job seekers are unable to find job details on various sites.

- The scraped job data's organization can be done in some external file(e.g., CSV, JSON, or database) to achieve easy access and filtering.
- Job tracking in a structured manner reduces human reliance on searches.
- The same program logic should be able to be modified to include all other websites and job categories to add the framework's adaptability.
